                            Harmony Baptist Church has been serving the Andalusia community with a heart for God and a love for people.
                            We are committed to proclaiming the love and grace of God as found in His Word.

                        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                        <p>
                            We exist to glorify God by believing in Jesus Christ, becoming His disciples, and building His kingdom.
                            We fulfill this mission by following the example of Jesus and building relationships with people of all backgrounds.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
                        <p>
                            Our vision is to see lives truly changed by the power of the gospel. We strive to love God with all that we have
                            and to love our neighbors as ourselves, sharing the good news that salvation is found by grace alone, through faith alone,
                            in Christ alone.
                        </p>

                        <h2>What We Believe</h2>
                        <p>
                            We believe that God loves all of creation, and through Jesus Christ we are brought into fellowship with God.
                            The Bible is our guide for faith and practice, and we seek to follow its teachings in all aspects of life.
